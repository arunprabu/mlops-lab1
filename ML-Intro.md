# Machine Learning Introduction

**ML** stands for **Machine Learning**, which is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make decisions or predictions from data without being explicitly programmed for every specific task.

## Key Concepts of Machine Learning:

### üéØ **What it does:**
- Algorithms automatically find patterns in data
- Makes predictions or decisions based on those patterns
- Improves performance with more data and experience

### üìä **Types of Machine Learning:**

#### 1. **Supervised Learning** - Learning with labeled examples
- **Classification** (predicting categories)
- **Regression** (predicting continuous values)

#### 2. **Unsupervised Learning** - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Clustering** (grouping similar data)
- **Dimensionality reduction**

#### 3. **Reinforcement Learning** - Learning through trial and error with rewards/penalties

### üîç **Common Applications:**
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis

### Dataset

A **dataset** is basically a collection of data, and it's what we use to train and test our machine learning models.

A dataset usually consists of rows and columns:

#### 1. Rows
Each row represents a single data point or an observation.  
For example, one row could be one student‚Äôs information, like their study hours and their exam score.

#### 2. Columns
Each column represents a feature or a variable.  
For example, one column could be the number of hours studied, and another column could be the exam score.

Datasets can be in various formats, like CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or even databases.  
The **quality** and **quantity** of the data are super important because they directly affect how well the model performs.

##### A few important concepts to consider about Datasets:

1. **Data Types**  
   Datasets can have different types of data. For example:
   - Numerical data (like exam scores)
   - Categorical data (like gender or grade levels)
   - Text or date data

2. **Missing Data**  
   Often, datasets have missing values. Handling missing data is crucial, and we can do that by either:
   - Filling in the gaps
   - Removing incomplete rows

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Before feeding data into a model, we often need to clean and prepare it. This can include:
   - Normalizing numerical values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Splitting the data into training and test sets

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   This involves creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.  
   For example:
   - Combining multiple columns
   - Extracting dates into separate features like year, month, and day

5. **Data Splitting**  
   We typically split the dataset into:
   - **Training set** ‚Äì used to teach the model
   - **Test set** ‚Äì used to evaluate its performance

### Popular Algorithms
	‚Ä¢	Linear Regression: Used for predicting continuous values.
	‚Ä¢	Decision Trees: Used for both classification and regression tasks.
	‚Ä¢	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies data based on the closest training examples.
	‚Ä¢	Support Vector Machines (SVM): Used for classification and regression by finding the optimal boundary.
	‚Ä¢	Neural Networks: Used for complex tasks like image and speech recognition.

Each has its own strengths and is suited for different types of tasks.


### üõ†Ô∏è **How it works:**
1. **Data Collection** - Gather relevant data
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Clean and prepare data
3. **Model Training** - Algorithm learns from data
4. **Model Evaluation** - Test performance
5. **Prediction** - Use model on new data

## üå∏ Example: Iris Classification

In our current project, we are working with the **Iris Classification** problem, which is a classic example of **supervised machine learning** for multiclass classification - where the algorithm learns to predict which species of iris flower based on measurements of its petals and sepals.

This demonstrates the complete ML workflow:
- **Data**: Iris flower measurements (features)
- **Labels**: Species names (target)
- **Algorithm**: Various classifiers (KNN, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- **Goal**: Predict species for new flower measurements
